# 🚀 Real‑Time Air Quality Dashboard 🌍

Welcome to the **Real‑Time Air Quality Dashboard** project! This friendly app shows live air quality data from a public API, presented in a beautiful, interactive dashboard. It's perfect for anyone curious about the environment and for those who want to see DevOps best practices in action—all for free! 🎉

## ✨ Features

- **Live Data Ingestion:**  
  Fetch real‑time air quality data (like AQI and pollutant levels) using a free API (e.g., [OpenAQ](https://docs.openaq.org/)).  
- **Backend API:**  
  A lightweight Python/Flask application that processes and serves the data through a REST endpoint (`/api/airquality`).  
- **Interactive Frontend:**  
  A modern React dashboard that displays the data with cool charts and maps.  
- **Containerization:**  
  Dockerize the backend for reproducible, hassle‑free deployments.  
- **CI/CD Pipeline:**  
  Automated testing and builds using GitHub Actions (all on the free tier!).  
- **Free Hosting:**  
  Deploy the frontend on GitHub Pages or Netlify and the backend on a free service like PythonAnywhere or Render. 😊

## 🛠️ Architecture Overview

1. **Data Ingestion & Processing:**  
   A Python script fetches and parses air quality data from OpenAQ.
2. **Backend API:**  
   A Flask app provides a RESTful API endpoint to serve the data.
3. **Frontend UI:**  
   A React app fetches data from the API and visualizes it interactively.
4. **DevOps Automation:**  
   Use Git, Docker, and GitHub Actions to automate testing, building, and deployment.
